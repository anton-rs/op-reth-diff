              Implements the Optimism Basic Payload Builder.
              If the `no_tx_pool` argument is passed in the payload attributes,
              the transaction pool will be ignored and the only transactions
              included in the payload will be those sent through the attributes.
              The L1BlockInfo must be parsed by the block builder to calculate the
              l1 tx cost for deposit transactions.
              Cumulative block gas computations change here as well depending on the
              hardforks activated, specifically Regolith and Bedrock.
              Adds the compute pending block option behind the optimism feature flag.
              Builds the payload if there is no tx pool enabled and the optimism chain spec is truthy.
