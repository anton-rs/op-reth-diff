            description: |
              Implements the Optimism Basic Payload Builder.
              If the `no_tx_pool` argument is passed in the payload attributes,
              the transaction pool will be ignored and the only transactions
              included in the payload will be those sent through the attributes.
              The L1BlockInfo must be parsed by the block builder to calculate the
              l1 tx cost for deposit transactions.
              Cumulative block gas computations change here as well depending on the
              hardforks activated, specifically Regolith and Bedrock.
              Adds the compute pending block option behind the optimism feature flag.
              Builds the payload if there is no tx pool enabled and the optimism chain spec is truthy.

              Adds contract creation support for the deposit transaction type by setting the tx nonce to the account nonce.

            description: |
              Implements the <code>BlockExecutor</code> trait on the <code>Executor</code> when the optimism feature flag is toggled.
              There is a bunch of optimism-specific transaction execution changes here.
              One is that pre-regolith hardfork, system transactions did not contribute to the block gas consumption.
              Prior to regolith, deposit transaction gas usage is equal to its gas limit.
              Post regolith, there are no more system transactions and deposit transactions report their actual gas usage.
              Failed deposit transactions must still have a receipt (handled by the <code>fail_deposit_tx!</code> macro).

              At the start of each L2 block, the L1 Block Info is posted.
              This provides L1 block information used to calculated the L1 cost of L2 transactions.
